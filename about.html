  <h1>Hi, I'm John Ragozzine.</h1>
  <p>
    An expat from New England based in Raleigh, NC, I am a Senior Scrum Master at <a href="https://alley.co/">Alley</a>, a fully distributed web consultancy, where I collaborate with clients on their web publish needs. I hold both CSM and PMP certifications, drawing from each as situations warrant. Prior to project management, I worked as a web developer, using CSS, PHP, JS, and good olâ€™ HTML to produce digital work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I rely on my academic background in writing, philosophy, and education&mdash;plus an inherent artistic streak&mdash;to succeed in a business that is as much about what you say as what you build.
