title: Can a project manager overplan?

As a project manager, I'm always planning. I'm planning out full projects or working with a team to define the scope of a single sprint. Each day, I'm planning for the future, but I'm also developing mini-plans to weather the circumstances of the day. Everything that happens in and around a project is something to be measured, analyzed, documented, and woven into a project's continuous fabric.

So, with all this planning, can a project manager ever do enough of it? Is the potential planning for a project infinite or will a PM always hit a point of entropy, after which any planning is just wasted energy spent on ineffective efforts?

The short answer is “No,” and the longer answer is “Gosh Yes.”

To explain, having a solid, well-thought out project plan at the beginning of any body of work is crucial. A project manager should throw themselves into project planning like an obsessive detective. It's never enough to just read the file handed to you by the frazzled police chief. You have to dissect, digest, and define every angle. You won't be done until you stagger back from your apartment wall—a wall covered in post-its and multi-pinned maps and mugshots—and, after blinking away your frenzied focus, you can see whodunit.

In other words, when you first get going, you better plan the heck out of your work. However, no amount of pre-planning will guarantee a turbulence-free project, because there's no such thing.

## Diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks
If you're applying a waterfall methodology to your project, you've done a lot of front-loaded planning. You've mapped out months and months of effort before you kick-off your project's Day One. Still, your plan is going to be tested by the unknown. Changes in team members, stakeholders, or project scope all threaten to jam a stick in your spokes, sending you headlong over the handlebars. I hope you were wearing a helmet.

But maybe you're leveraging the adaptability of the Scrum ideology of Agile project management. In this case, you've done extensive high-level scoping with your stakeholders and project team to populate your project's backlog. Also, you've done more specific short-term planning during your sprint kick-off, mapping out in detail what your team will fully accomplish over the next two weeks. Still, things don't stay consistent day-to-day, so even in limiting your deepest planning to only 10-14 business days, you're not safe from a sick day or scope creep request.

In both cases, the lesson remains the same: plan your heart out, but be ready to deal with changes throughout your project's lifecycle. There's a distinct difference between project planning and project management. Project management is not about planning; <a href="https://twitter.com/_ragozzine/status/693439196158152705">project management is about risk management</a>. Don't try to be Nostradamus, just be Bruce Banner—remain calm in the face of hulking catastrophe or your project is going to get smashed.

Stay flexible, my friends. Plan, but don't stress yourself out with overplanning. No matter what, the plans you set out at the start will not be the identical twin of how you successfully completed your objectives. Cousins hopefully, but you never can tell.
