title: Estimate it live

Often during a client meeting, there are times when a defined scope of work is hypothetically augmented by a simple “could it do this?” or “can it do that?” comment. Invariably, the answer to such inquiries is a “yes” followed by an immediate “but” (#immediatebut). Unless the request is fully impossible—e.g. Can this website teleport me to a bouncy house containing a million fat-free-but-still-good-tasting all-beef cheeseburgers served on levitating golden plates of pure love?—with infinite time and budget, nearly anything is possible on the web.

So what do you do when you’re in a client call and are faced with an unknown body of work in real-time? A knee-jerk reaction might be to label this scope creep, blow a whistle on the play, and stop all forward progress until you can regroup.

Yes, scope creep needs to be managed at all times. However, it doesn’t need to be treated as such a red flag during client interactions. Rather, you can estimate it live, but with a catch.

When a client brings up a fresh thought or add-on feature, they’re not trying to pull a fast one on you. This isn’t a bad thing. In fact, it’s a GREAT thing. This means that the client is engaged with your code work, excited with your presentation of it, and their brain is stimulated enough to extrapolate further down the road with heretofore unbuilt functionality. In short, you’re doing a bang-up job of introducing this work to them and they’re captivated enough to ask for more.

What you do not want to do in these moments is stymie the engagement and lose momentum. The inertia of project productivity can be tricky to get going, and even trickier to cultivate, so avoid putting up roadblocks in the face of ambiguity. The worst thing you can do is squelch this fledging interest outright with a bureaucratic brick wall. However, the _second_ worst thing you can do is just nod your head and take on this new request without resetting the client’s expectations as to how this request affects the budget (HINT: additional features cost more). Instead, you need to find a middle road between these extremes by using the only project management tool that is more vital than spreadsheets: Words.

When faced with an off-the-cuff estimate request, your job is to welcome the suggestion, ask smart questions to define it further, then move the conversation to how this will affect the overall budget. Don’t make up a number of hours. Instead, use your experience to judge whether the request is small, medium, or large.

My mental cheatsheet for this is to translate small as being half a day’s work (4 hours), medium being a single day’s work (8 hours), and large being more than a day’s work (?? hours).

Just this framing alone can help a client decide whether they want to pursue this request further and have you obtain a true estimate from your development team or just drop it. Ideally, you are grooming a project backlog already and can add any abandoned ideas to it for future consideration.

Welcome these conversation and don’t be fearful of the unknown. Help your clients translate their impromptu requests into dollars by way of a caveated, extemporaneous estimate and everyone will leave the meeting feel heard, prepared for next steps, and ready to continue forward momentum on the project.
